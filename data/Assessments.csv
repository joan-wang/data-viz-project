The Government also implemented the Action Plan for the Social-Economic Reintegration of Women and Girl Victims by providing education and social services to girl victims of forced labor and human trafficking. However, children in Albania engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining and forced begging. The law does not criminally prohibit using, procuring, or offering children for illicit activities.

The Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security conducted trainings on child labor and adolescent work for labor inspectors, government officials, and union delegates around the country. The National Commission for the Eradication of Child Labor coordinated government efforts to implement child labor research, strengthen child labor law enforcement, and develop commitments by the private sector to prevent and eliminate child labor. In addition, the Government convened agencies from the UN System for Development in Argentina to discuss plans for the IV Global Conference on Child Labor, which Argentina will host in 2017 in cooperation with the ILO. The Government also expanded the Universal Child Allowance Program to more than 3.7 million children. However, children in Argentina perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Children also engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking.

7,Minimal Advancement,4,Azerbaijan,8,"In 2016, Azerbaijan made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Despite new initiatives to address child labor, Azerbaijan is receiving this assessment because it implemented a regression in practice that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. In 2016, the Government suspended all labor inspections not based on a formal complaint, imposing a moratorium on inspections during the reporting period. Otherwise, the Government made efforts by providing training for labor inspectors and continuing a cash transfer program for vulnerable families. Children in Azerbaijan perform dangerous tasks in street work, and also engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Legal protections for workers only apply to workers with written employment contracts, leaving self-employed children and children working outside of formal employment relationships vulnerable to exploitation.

In addition, the Government funded 16 NGOs to implement programs to address human trafficking. However, Children in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) perform dangerous tasks in street work. Children also engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation as a result of human trafficking. The Government lacks a mechanism to coordinate its efforts to address child labor, including its worst forms. In addition, the minimum age protections in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska, and Brcko District labor codes do not apply to children who are self-employed or working outside formal employment relationships.

20,No Assessment,1,Burma,21,"In 2016, no assessment has been made regarding Burma's efforts to advance the elimination of the worst forms of child labor because this is the first year that efforts have been assessed and suggested actions provided for Burma. Based on research regarding Burma's efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor, the Government made several efforts, but the military was also complicit in the use of forced child labor. Government efforts in Burma included amending the Shops and Establishments Act and the Factories Act to raise the minimum age for work to 14 and the minimum age for dangerous work to 18 in these sectors. In addition, the military provided its personnel, training centers, and recruitment officials with training and improved age assessment and verification procedures to enhance the military's ability to identify and prevent child soldier recruitment. Burma's military released 112 children and young people who had been recruited into armed forces as children, and sanctioned 13 officers and 23 non-commissioned personnel for the recruitment and use of children in the armed forces. However, Burma's military continued to use some children as combatants, porters and cooks in conflict areas. Children in Burma also performed dangerous tasks in garment production. Despite steady progress, military oversight and monitoring of recruitment procedures were insufficient to completely eliminate the recruitment of children.

Despite new initiatives to address child labor, Georgia is receiving this assessment because it continued to implement a law that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. The Government failed to remedy the abolition of its labor inspectorate, caused by its adoption of the current Labor Code in 2006. Since that time, the Government has lacked a functioning labor inspection mechanism to monitor, inspect, and enforce child labor laws. Otherwise, the Government made efforts by publishing a National Child Labor Survey and both enacting and drafting legislation intended to improve ease of access to social services for children living and working on the street. Children in Georgia perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Children also engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced begging. The Government lacks a coordinating mechanism to address child labor. In addition, the compulsory education age left 15-year-old children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor, as they are not required to be in school, but are not legally permitted to work full-time.",1153,2016

In addition, the Government continued developing the National Plan of Action Phase II on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Labor, signed memoranda of understanding with 20 institutions responsible for its implementation, and expanded its Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty program into 28 new districts. The Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development also introduced a new program to transition from a manual birth registration process to automated registration, which is likely to increase the number of children with birth certificates and facilitate school registrations and employment age verification.

The Government's ability to prevent children from becoming engaged in the worst forms of child labor is limited because existing laws do not comprehensively prohibit child trafficking and the commercial sexual exploitation of children.

The Government re-established the Inter-institutional Committee Against Trafficking and partnered with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which works directly with technology companies to obtain tips about child trafficking and pornography. The Government also passed a law restoring administrative sanction authority to the Ministry of Labor. However, children in Guatemala perform dangerous tasks in agriculture. Children are also engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. The lack of  sufficient labor inspectors and vehicles and inability to assess fines, coupled with inadequate judicial enforcement of court orders, limited the Government's capacity to combat the worst forms of child labor.

421,Significant Advancement,3,Thailand,127,"In 2014, Thailand made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Despite political unrest during the year and a military coup in May 2014, the Government took actions to address child labor. Thailand made changes to its legal framework to raise the minimum age for agricultural work from 13 to 15 years, and for work on sea fishing vessels from 16 to 18 years. It also created a national policy committee, including several subcommittees and task forces, to improve policy formulation, interagency coordination, and implementation regarding migrant workers and human trafficking problems. In addition, the Government funded and participated in multiple programs that include the goal of eliminating or preventing child labor, including its worst forms. However, children in Thailand continue to engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the shrimp and seafood processing sector, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Thailand remains weak in its enforcement efforts, particularly in the fishing, agriculture, manufacturing, and home-based business sectors, as well as in the informal sector. The Government also lacks nationwide data on child labor, which impedes the effectiveness of policies and programs.",274,2014

The Government reported training prosecutors, police, and victim service providers on human trafficking issues. Although research is limited, there is evidence that children are engaged in child labor in domestic work.

The Directorate General for Migration Management, a new coordinating body for the implementation of migration law, including laws related to child trafficking and refugee children, began functioning during the reporting period. In addition, together with the EU, the Government funded a project that included the goal of combating child labor by helping parents of working children to find employment. The Government also trained labor inspectors and law enforcement personnel on issues related to child trafficking and hazardous child labor. However, children in Turkey are engaged in child labor in agriculture, including in mobile seasonal work, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. The Government does not have laws that protect children working in agricultural enterprises employing fewer than 50 workers, in small shops employing up to three persons, or in domestic work. In addition, children in the growing Syrian refugee population in Turkey have low access to education and other social services, which leaves them at increased risk of exploitation in the worst forms of child labor.",280,2014

The Ministry of Labor hired 20 additional labor inspectors and the Ministry of Interior held a series of workshops to train police, immigration officials, prosecutors, and judges on human trafficking issues. However, children in Uruguay continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor in garbage scavenging and commercial sexual exploitation. The Government does not collect or publish information on the number of investigations, prosecutions, and convictions for labor and criminal law violations. Uruguay lacks a comprehensive national child labor policy, and programs to prevent and eliminate child labor are limited.",285,2014
433,No Advancement - Efforts Made But Complicit,12,Uzbekistan,139,"In 2014, Uzbekistan made efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, but was also complicit in the use of forced child labor in the cotton sector. While the central Government made concerted efforts to prevent and to remediate forced child labor in cotton production, Uzbekistan is receiving an assessment of no advancement because of government complicity in forced child labor, particularly at the local level. Although there was no evidence of a large-scale, centrally-coordinated, forced mobilization of children, some local officials, in more than an isolated incident, continued to mobilize children during the cotton harvest. In committing to end this practice, the Cabinet of Ministers declared its intent to ensure that no one under the age of 18 would participate in the cotton harvest; broadly communicated its new commitment through awareness-raising campaigns to prevent children from being forcibly mobilized to pick cotton; and sponsored after-school programs as an alternative to child labor. The Government also led a monitoring effort utilizing ILO methodology to observe the fall 2014 harvest in all cotton-growing regions of the country, finding 41 child laborers, assessing penalties to 19 school officials and farm managers for the use of child labor, and removing children from the fields. Despite efforts to end the mobilization of children, in the course of widespread mobilization of third-year secondary school students (predominantly age 18) to pick cotton, an unknown number of 17-year-old students were also mobilized through this practice. Independent observers also reported some cases in several provinces in which younger students were mobilized. In a few instances, reports indicate that a local government authority such as a district or regional governing official (hokim) or town mayor may have directly ordered the mobilization of students under age 18. In at least some cases, callers to hotlines for reporting labor violations in the harvest were unable to get through, leaving an important gap in the system for receiving and processing child labor complaints. The Government also maintained policies in the cotton sector that mandate regional harvest quotas and set crop prices at levels that create incentives for local administrators to forcibly mobilize labor, creating an ongoing risk of mobilized child labor. Several observers stated that any reduction in the mobilization of children was offset by an increase in the compulsory mobilization of adult labor, although this trend could not be confirmed. Some of these observers reported surveillance, intimidation, and detention by the local government authorities while attempting to gather information about labor practices in the cotton harvest.",286,2014

The law does not establish a minimum age for hazardous work and the law does not prohibit hazardous occupations and activities for children. A mechanism to coordinate government efforts to combat child labor has not been established. Vanuatu does not have any social programs to address child labor, including its worst forms.",287,2014
